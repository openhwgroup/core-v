# Software TG monthly meeting - Verilator modeling update (11 Oct 2021)

## Overview

No work has been possible this month.

The project continues to struggle with lack of resource, with a delay of 16 weeks so far to the second milestone.  Analysis showed that there was been 8 hours/week contributed over the project to mid-September, rather than the planned 16 hours/week.  The plan has been updated to reflect this as the planning assumption going forward.

As a result, the forecast completion date is now 4 months late than forecast last month, although this must be regarded as more realistic.

## Milestone progress

The [detailed plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl_GIklam3redWNj_DRVRVVBD49LvLD8k1zeFsJXllc) is a Google Doc.  A high level view is also available as a [Kanban board](https://github.com/openhwgroup/embdebug-target-core-v/projects/1).

Progress is shown as a percentage of tasks completed.
