# Verilator modeling project update (February 2022)

This report is produced monthly, typically in time for the Software TG meeting, since this preceeds the Hardware TG meeting.

## Overview

This is the first report, since November 2021. Work has resumed this month.  Three key news items.

1. Restarting work identified an issue in the core-v-mcu repository, which had broken the `make model-lib` target, and then yielded a non-working model.  However this was quickly fixed (thanks to Greg Martin).

2. The JTAG TAP driver is now complete. It can read and write all registers and memories.

3. Hiatus in the project means the completion date is now forecast to be 26 June 2022 (2.5 month slip since last report).

This is now the starting point for bringing up the debug server.

## Milestone progress

The [detailed plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl_GIklam3redWNj_DRVRVVBD49LvLD8k1zeFsJXllc) is a Google Doc.  A high level view is also available as a [Kanban board](https://github.com/openhwgroup/embdebug-target-core-v/projects/1).

Progress is shown as a percentage of tasks completed.
