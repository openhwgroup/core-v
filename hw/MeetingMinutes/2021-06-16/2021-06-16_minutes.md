## Agenda:
1. Introductory presentation by Dr. Li Chen, University of Saskatchewan
  * Li’s research is in radiation tolerant/hardened ASICs, including microprocessors; has an interest to implement CV32E40P-based platform using rad-hard libraries
  * Li was not sure about the complexity of core-v-mcu versus PULPissimo
    * Core-v-mcu is designed to be parametrizable, and it should be straightforward to strip the platform down to a minimal set of elements (no eFPGA, minimal I/O)
    * Greg (QuickLogic) can advise on how to do this; Tim can setup call with Li and his students and Greg to discuss
2. Regression/CI discussion
  * Richard (AWS) wants to setup a core-v-mcu board in their remote test lab along with several other RISC-V chips to run CI tests for FreeRTOS every evening
  * Aim is to have one FreeRTOS kernel port across multiple RISC-V cores
  * For core-v-mcu, the FPGA platform (Digilent NexsyA7-100T, Genesys2) is fine; noted that Genesys2 will eventually support the 64-bit core as well
    * Need to be able to remote flash the device, observe output (e.g., UART) to see if tests pass or fail
    * Hugh will send Richard info on the boards and components required for setup
    * This is similar to what QuickLogic have setup already with NexysA7-100T board
    * Eventually this would also support the core-v-mcu SOC development board
  * Amazon has FPGAs in the cloud also—would they want to use those? Probably not for Richard’s CI/CD, but could be useful to expose to other people
    * Cloud CI/CD is handled by another AWS person who is off this month; he would know about cloud-hosted FPGA
  * Florian took an action to setup a discussion for technical issues
3. Integrating CV32E40S with core-v-mcu
  * CV32E40S core is in development, led by Silabs; 32-bit embedded class core with security features/extensions
  * Project team is assessing if there is interest to have core integrated in core-v-mcu
    * Intent is not to impact the current core-v-mcu tape-out with CV32E40P (Fall 2021)
    * QuickLogic is working to have core-v-mcu parameterized to make the back-end flows easier to manage; would need to understand if this is a total rework, or if this can be handled via parameters/options
    * Unibo team is working on a CV32E40S test chip, not under OpenHW Group
    * Li Chen is interested in potentially implementing with his rad-hard library; this could be a good candidate project for the OpenHW Accelerate program
4. Core-v-mcu project
  * Anthony (QuickLogic) presented development board specs/options, and will post slides
  * It is beneficial to make distinction between an eval board with  I/O isolation and test points, versus a development kit; OpenHW wants to build development kits in some volume (up to 10000) that is focussed on SW developers
    * Characterization/eval board 10-20 boards, several 1000s per run; ~$1000 each
  * Could be a 2-board solution
    * Researchers in CMC’s community would probably be interested in doing power measurements, etc., versus pure software development
    * CMC will manufacture and sell the boards
    * Development kit should offer over air update
