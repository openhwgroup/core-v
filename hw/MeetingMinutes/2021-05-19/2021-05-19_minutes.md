## Agenda and discussion:


## 1. CORE-V-MCU Verilator

  * Jeremy has picked up the work from Florian, created a simple loop that puts the processor through reset and then runs the clock
    * Performance is low (30kHz—the PULP model runs at 800kHz with some tuning)
  * Concern about the number of warnings when running Verilator
    * 944 warnings
    * Need an action to deal with all the warnings; Jeremy will raise the issue in Github and we can triage from there
  * Next step is to replace simple test bench with debug server (Embdebug); there appears to be a gap in the documentation regarding what the JTAG registers mean
    * Florian suggested Jeremy open an issue to fix the documentation
    * The JTAG registers are described in the RISC-V Debug Specification 0.13 (Section 6.1 Debug Transport Module)
  * Randy from QuickLogic will bring up Verilator for CI; boot from a ROM and run tests
  * Jeremy, Duncan, Randy, and Florian will update the project concept document; agreed to meet on Friday for further discussion


## 2. CORE-V-MCU Verification IP

  * We discussed Mike’s research and recommendations on Verification IP needs for CORE-V-MCU
  * Overall, it’s a fairly bleak landscape on what is ready available
  * There should be an effort to get fully-verified peripherals that anyone can use
  * The block diagram on Slide 2 currently doesn’t exist; we emulate on FPGA, which is not satisfactory for CI purposes
  * We can put some peripherals into a kind of loopback mode
    * Hook UART1 TX to UART2 RX
    * I2C master can talk to I2C slave
    * Build a simple behavioural model for QSPI (write 4 bytes, read 4 bytes)
    * For camera, use PWM output to generate sync signals, and use GPIO for data
    * JTAG debug model is coming from Jeremy
    * SDIO still needs a solution   
  * Does Renode fit into this picture? AntMicro may have some models for these peripherals
    * Tim can ask if they have models
    * We want to ensure models are written in Verilog so they can be used in a variety of simulators
  * Start with simple models that get more interesting over time
  * Action: create a test bench directory in core-v-mcu repo with subdirectories for each component (uart, etc.)
    * One day, these may get migrated to separate repos and become a reference set; OpenHW Group can become the place for high quality open source VIP
  * Mike will post updated version of his slides to reflect feedback
