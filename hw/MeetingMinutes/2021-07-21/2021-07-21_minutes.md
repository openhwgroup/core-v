## HW TG - July 21, 2021

### Attendees:
- Hugh Pollitt-Smith
- Anthony Le
- Davide Schiavone
- Duncan Bees
- Greg Martin
- Jeremy Bennett
- Tim Saxe

### Agenda/notes:

- CORE-V-MCU SoC update
    - Quicklogic targeting soft RTL freeze for end of July
    - Greg will get in touch with Jeremy regarding number of harts in the platform, align the debug core with the MCU hardware
    - Greg still has an open pull request under review; anticipate another one for end of July soft RTL freeze
    - Tim will send Duncan a copy of the MCU checklist
- CORE-V-MCU DevKit/SDK
    - Duncan presented slides/diagrams showing relationships between the various CORE-V-MCU projects
        - Duncan and Jeremy will revise and present at the TWG (July 26)
    - The DevKit is the whole thing that you ship to the customer (hardware, SDK, tools, simulation, etc.); 
        - SDK is delivered via the Quickstart Guide (i.e., instructions where/how to download and install)
        - First version of the SDK will not include HAL and would be specific to the CORE-V-MCU; eventually SDK will be generic and will drive other architectures
    - Verilator modeling project is specific to the CORE-V-MCU, but could be used for other cores
    - For the SDK, don’t underestimate the level of effort required to develop; needs funding/resource commitments, testing, integration, documentation, training/videos
        - Need a project lead who knows how to put a SDK together
        - Will need commitments from the other SW projects in terms of delivering to a schedule
        - SDK project concept could be created before a project leader is identified
        - SDK should be pulling together things that already exist—is there a MVP version of each of the SW components?
            - Identify specific versions/tags for each of the components
    - Embedded FPGA flow (Symbiflow) is also part of the ecosystem, but not part of the SDK; it will need to be part of the Quickstart Guide as well
    - Anthony will post slides in the HW DevKit Mattermost channel to get feedb
