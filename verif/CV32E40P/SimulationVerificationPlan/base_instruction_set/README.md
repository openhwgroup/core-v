This is the directory for the RV32IMC `Base Instruction Set` [CV32E40P high-level feature](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/tree/master/doc) Verification Plans (aka Test Plans) for the CV32E40P.  They are generic enough to be applicable to virtually any RV32IMC core and should be used as the starting point for future CORE-V Verification Plans.
