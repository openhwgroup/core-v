# OpenHW Project Concept Proposal: CORE-V Software Development Kit (SDK)

## Summary of project

This project aims to create and maintain a production quality SDK as part of
the CORE-V Development
Kit. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) provides a good description of a SDK

This Concept Proposal focuses on the first version of a SDK for the CORE-V MCU development kit project based on the CV32E40P core. Work to support other platforms in the future will be the subject of separate proposals.

The key objectives are:

- the SDK must be a positive ["out-of-the-box"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_box_%28feature%29) experience for end users;
- The SDK must include example programs that can run immediately and then be modified to act as starting points for user code;
- the SDK must support both bare metal and FreeRTOS based development; and
- the SDK must support use of Symbiflow hardware design tools to support the on-board programmable FPGA.

The SDK is a deliverable into the overall Development Kit project, which will be responsible for delivery of the complete product, including the SoC, the physical development board (which may include a prototype for early testing purposes), its manufacture, marketing and distribution.

This Concept Proposal addresses version 1 of the SDK only. It will not include the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), since this component, which will in turn require changes to the compiler tool chain, FreeRTOS kernel and FreeRTOS drivers, will not be ready in time.  We shall include the standard upstream GNU compiler tool chain, since the CORE-V specific GNU compiler tool chain is unlikely to be complete in time.  There is no proposal to support the Clang/LLVM compiler tool chain.

##  Components

The SDK runs on a _host_ computer (typically a PC running Windows, MacOS or Linux), connected via USB to the CORE-V MCU reference board, as shown in the following diagram:

![diagram showing host connected to reference board](./images/devkit.jpg)

The SDK consists of some components which run on the host computer, and some which are loaded on to the CORE-V MCU reference board.  The components which are on the host are shown in the following diagram:

![diagram showing host sided SDK components](./images/sdk.jpg)

The components which may be loaded on to the CORE-V MCU reference board include the HAL (although not in versions 1), the FreeRTOS kernel and drivers, the compiler and operating system libraries, and the applications, which may be derived from the examples within the SDK.  These are shown in the following diagram:

![diagram showing reference board  SDK components](./images/refbrdsw.jpg)

See the [Summary of requirements](#summary-of-requirements) for the requirements driving each of these components.

### Component 1 - OpenHW IDE and debugger

This is based on Eclipse CDT.  It is divided into two sub-components:

* The **IDE** component comprising  "ready-to-launch" application examples for the list of supported boards, tool chains, debuggers, and libraries; and

* The **Debugger** component, which will supply corresponding binaries plus connection and initialization parameters.

**Status as of September 2021:** Initial development by Alexander Fedorov operational, with minimal examples and using the upstream compiler tool chain. Debugger integration for the development board will be required, and cannot be started until this is fully specified, nor tested until hardware is available. Symbiflow tooling (see [Component 5](#component-5---symbiflow-tooling)) support will require additional work

### Component 2 - Compiler tool chain

For the first version of the tool chain, this will be the standard upstream GNU tool chain, combined with the upstream newlib library for bare metal use.

The first version of the newlib library will work directly to the board hardware. A small amount of work to specialize newlib for the hardware (C start up code, variants to drive output to the UART) will be required. Future releases of the SDK will drive the hardware via the HAL. Hardware will be required to allow the tool chain to be regression tested for the CORE-V MCU.

**Status as of September 2021:** The standard upstream GNU tool chain for RISC-V is available from [Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/). This includes the upstream newlib, which is intended for QEMU simulator use and includes compilation for the proposed RISC-V semihosting protocol.

### Component 3 - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The first version of the SDK will not include the HAL, since it will not be ready in time.  It is not just the timing of HAL availability, since this component will in turn require changes to the compiler tool chain, FreeRTOS kernel and FreeRTOS drivers.

It is worth noting that HAL development is difficult, and has to be right first time. This requires extensive testing with many different communities of potential users.

### Component 4 - FreeRTOS

This is a combination of the kernel and drivers for the various devices on the development kit board (UART, WiFi, LEDs). The first version will be a direct port to the hardware, subsequent versions will sit on top of the HAL.

**Status as of September 2021:** The FreeRTOS kernel for PULP has been ported to CORE-V MCU, but has been blocked by hardware issues. No CORE-V MCU drivers have been written. Note that development of drivers will require the specification of the devices to be finalized, and testing of drivers will require physical hardware.

### Component 5 - Symbiflow tooling

Support for Symbiflow tooling will require work in the IDE to allow access to the tools.  This proposal assumes that standard upstream tools will be used.

This is a "virtual" component. The tasks to deliver it form part of [Component 1](#component-1---openhw-ide-and-debugger), [Component 6](#component-6---documentation) and [Component 7](#component-7---examplesapplications).

### Component 6 - Documentation

This is one of the critical components to the out-of-box experience.

This includes getting started guides, user manuals, and the wiki for user contributions.  Whilst it is documentation of the SDK, like all SDK components it is intimately connected to the physical product of which it is part.  It includes documentation in a range of formats:

- printed text;
- online text;
- help systems; and
- video.

Documentation of tutorials is a separate component (see [Component 7](#component-7---examplesapplications)). Likely a specific Internet domain to support all this material online will be required.

**Status as of September 2021:** Standard GNU tool chain manuals for RISC-V are available.

### Component 7 - Examples/applications

This is one the critical components to the out-of-box experience. Tutorials must include:

- blinking LEDs;
- examples of driving all the devices on the board from bare metal;
- minimal FreeRTOS example;
- FreeRTOS examples showing all device drivers (particularly the WiFi driver); and
- Symbiflow example.

The examples are both a tutorial resource and a starting point for the user's own products. Each tutorial will require comprehensive documentation in both written and video forms.

**Status as of September 2021:** Not started.

### Component 8 - Overall SDK integration and installer

The SDK _is_ the integration of all the previous components combined with an installer.  The goal for the _installer and updater_ is that it is provided as a single, binary executable file which when executed installs everything ready-to-run. Everything will be included in the single installer binary (including the IDE, debugger, tool chains, documentation and examples etc.). The user simply downloads the file from the OpenHW SDK web page and executes it to install everything. Specific flavors will be needed for Windows, Linux (various) and MacOS host operating systems.

**Status as of September 2021:** Not started

## Why Open Hardware Group should do this project

The SDK is the "shop window" for the CORE-V project. It is the vehicle through which uses will experience CORE-V for the first time. The user must be able to install software seamlessly and be able to get started with their first project easily.  This will require a set of "starter" example projects, getting started guides, tutorials, user manuals and reference documentation, much provided both as physical text and via video and online help systems.

### Summary of Development

The Platform Development Kit is the linked receiving project for the SDK and will provide:

- overall program management;
- MCU design, development and manufacturer;
- prototype and final reference board development and manufacture including certification and silkscreen;
- documentation of hardware components in all formats (printed text, online text, online help, video); and
- complete product packaging, marketing and distribution.

The following diagram shows the relationship of the SDK to the Platform Development Kit project.

## Engineering Resource

### OpenHW engineering staff resource plan: requirement and availability

None, beyond routine sysadmin support.

### Engineering resource supplied by members - requirement and availability

It cannot be emphasized too much that the requirement here is for **experienced specialist software engineering**.  This is the shop front for OpenHW and the qualify of the SDK will be the perceived quality of OpenHW.

Unless **otherwise indicated in bold**, resource is not yet available. In summary at present there is a shortfall of 35 - 41 specialist engineer months and 12 engineer months of project manager. These figures exclude work to support Symbiflow.

- Component 1 - OpenHW IDE and debugger

  - specification of the debugger interface;
  - hardware for testing;
  - 1 engineer month expertise in Eclipse CDT debugger integration;
  - 1 engineer month expertise in Eclipse CDT third party tool integration (Symbiflow); and
  - 2 engineer months expertise in example integration within Eclipse CDT.

- Component 2 - Compiler tool chain

  - specification of devices to allow newlib BSP development;
  - hardware for testing; and
  - 1 engineer month expertise in newlib BSP development, (**provided by Embecosm**).

- Component 3 - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): N/A
- Component 4 - FreeRTOS

  - specification of all devices for which drivers will be required;
  - hardware for testing;
  - 1 engineer month of FreeRTOS kernel expertise to complete and test the kernel port for CORE-V MCU; and
  - up to 6 engineer months of FreeRTOS driver development expertise to write native drivers for the CORE-V MCU devices.

- Component 5 - Symbiflow tooling: N/A
- Component 6 - Documentation:

  - specification of all components in sufficient detail that documentation is possible
  - hardware against which to verify the documentation
  - 6-12 months specialist technical documentation skills for embedded engineering, including video skills.

- Component 7 - Examples/applications

  - specification of all components in sufficient detail that tutorial development can be started;
  - hardware on which to develop and validate the tutorials; and
  - 12 months specialist engineering tutorial developer for embedded engineering, including with video skills.

- Component 8 - Overall SDK integration and installer

  - platforms running the various operating systems to be supported;
  - hardware on which to develop and validate the tutorials; and
  - 6 engineer months specialist in multi-platform installed development, for which **Ashling can contribute leadership**, but will require third party provision of the specialist resource.

In addition the whole project will need a full time overall project manager, estimated at 12 engineer months for the first version of the SDK.  Again, **Ashling can contribute leadership**, but will require third party provision of the specialist resource.

## Marketing resource

This belongs with the linked project, the Platform Development Kit.

### OpenHW marketing resource - requirement and availability

None for this project.

### Marketing resource supplied by members - requirement and availability

None for this project.

## Funding

### Funding supplied by OpenHW - requirement and availability

Servers to host all the installers and tutorial materials.

### Funding supplied by members - requirement and availability

As noted in [Engineering resource supplied by members](#engineering-resource-supplied-by-members---requirement-and-availability), there is a shortfall of 35-41 engineer months.

Skills needed are in the software members of OpenHW, which form a minority of the members, and tend to be smaller companies.  If resource cannot be provided in kind, then cross-funding from larger hardware companies to smaller software companies may be needed.

## Architecture diagram

The architecture was shown in the introduction to the [Components](#components) section above.

## Who would make use of OpenHW output

Everyone adopting the Platform Development Kit.

## Project license model

The licensing is a synthesis of the licensing of the components (see [External dependencies](#external-dependencies)). There is no meaningful way to describe the license of the project as a whole.

## Description of initial code contribution, if required

None.

## Repository Structure

We shall need a `core-v-sdk` repository for the integration materials/installed, and all the tutorials and documentation. The structure will be defined by those two component development teams

## Project distribution model

Supplied as a deliverable to the linked project, the Platform Development Kit.

## Preliminary Project plan

Not required for concept phase approval.

## Preliminary Risk Register

Risk is scored as likelihood (1-10) x impact (1-3) with mitigation required for any risk with score of 10 or more, of with an impact of 3 (project killer).
