## High Level Summary of project, project components, and deliverables
The Hardware Abstract Layer (HAL) project for Core-V-MCU aims to define and release a set of specifications for the Core-V HAL.

It also will provide a reference implementation of the specified HAL which will comprise a part of the Core-V-MCU Software Development Kit (SDK), which involves HAL driver of such peripherals Core-V-MCU supports.

By defining a HAL specification applicable to Core-V cores, we can benefit from the HAL-based SDK as follows: 
- Offer a common approach to development of driver-level software for Core-V cores in order to simplify software reuse and reduce cost;
- Make consistent system startup code for system initialization and software access to chip and board level peripherals;
- Enable software developers to develop hardware independent application code as well as firmware developers to communicate with new and customized hardware components under a consistent framework; 
- Allows end-users to tailor and extend the HAL to address their own platform requirements according to well defined procedures.

## Summary of market or input requirements

### Known market/project requirements at PC gate
- Significantly reduce cost in SoC driver development, by defining an approach to enable driver reuse according to an accepted framework;
- Make consistent the upper layer software across different SoC. This requires standard HAL APIs to isolate hardware and software resources in such a manner that makes it easy to migrate software across platforms.

## Who would make use of OpenHW output
CORE-V HAL will be used by firmware, middleware and application developers who are developing code supporting Core-V based hardware designs.

It will be a key component of a Core-V MCU SDK.

 
## Initial Estimate of Timeline
HALs take many years to develop. For example, Arm's CMSIS is around 15 years old. At this stage we propose a 3-month period to agree the approach and develop detailed plans for Project Launch. At that time we shall have a more accurate understanding of the deliverables and the timescale over which they can be completed.

During this 3-month period, objectives are:

- To agree the key technical requirements for a CORE-V HAL that will be re-used for all CORE-V Cores
- To agree the technical approach
- To agree the approach for specification 

Once the HAL approach is agreed, Project Launch will be sought.  Steps that will then be taken include:
   - To implement basic peripherals (UART, TIME, INT...) on CORE-V MCU.
   - To have FreeRTOS run  on CORE-V MCU in conjunction with HAL


## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project

- The HAL is needed to establish a baseline approach for addressing the Core-V Cores and peripherals under a consistent approach. It is a cornerstone of all Core-V SDK and software work.

- There are some challenges for Core-V MCU users to develop application bases on adopted PULP SDK due to the complexity of the development configuration environment. The PULP SDK is not viewed as a basis for future development work. 

- There should be an out-of-box SDK solution offered by OpenHW supporting Core-V MCU platform developer.

- An easy-to-use SDK enhances the Core-V MCU development environment by reducing the barrier on software development and enabling to create reusable application code.

- There are some requirement from system tools (such as compiler) to help verify their design's performance and correctness using HAL SDK.

## Industry landscape: description of competing, alternative, or related efforts in the industry
There are also some similar standards in market currently, the most representative HAL is below:
   1. CMSIS for ARM cortex A and M architecture
   https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/cmsis
   
   2. NMSIS for RISC-V architecture
   https://doc.nucleisys.com/nmsis/
   
   3. CSI for RISC-V architecture
   English translation is in progress
   
   4. FreeRTOS CommonIO specification https://developer.amazon.com/acs-devices
