# OpenHW Project Concept Proposal: CV32E40Pv2
*The PC proposal introduces the project and explains the market drivers and the "why"* 

# Title of Project - "CV32E40Pv2"
# Project Concept Proposal
## Date of proposal - 2021-06-28
## Author(s) - Olivier Montfort (Dolphin Design), Pascal Gouedo (Dolphin Design), Yoann Pruvost (Dolphin Design)

## High Level Summary of project, project components, and deliverables
This proposal is about verifying XPULP, RVF, and Zfinx ISA extensions that were disabled during CV32E40P v1 phase improving performances, power consumption and even code size depending of application programs.

## Summary of market or input requirements




### Known market/project requirements at PC gate

Re-encode in Custom extension and Verify following PULP "basic" instructions:
* Post-increment and register-register indexed load/store
* Hardware loops
* General ALU extensions
* Immediate branch
* Multiply-accumulate

Re-encode in Custom extension and Verify following PULP instructions:
* Bit manipulation
* SIMD (16 and 8-bit data) 
* Event load

For Multicore cluster area reduction,
* Verify PULP Zfinx?
* or Re-Design (if needed) and Verify Zfinx as described in [zfinx-spec-20210511-0.41](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-zfinx/blob/main/zfinx-spec-20210511-0.41.pdf)
* Make it optional with a parameter? 

Floating Point Unit
* Keep FPU instructions decoding inside the Core and dispatch to APU interface and
  Verify RISC-V standard F extension instructions (Zfinx and non-Zfinx) with coupled Core-FPnew?
* or Merge ETH CV-X-IF and only Verify this interface?

### Potential future design enhancements
* Conversion of PULP Bit Manipulation & SIMD instruction to ratified RISC-V B and P extensions.
* Add Zce extension for further code-size reduction (not required for Multicore cluster).
* Add bus attributes and errors.

## Who would make use of OpenHW output
Companies needing more performances, less energy consumption or smaller code size for standard control or DSP-like computing applications.


## Initial Estimate of Timeline
At Project Concept:
* Preliminary RTL release in 2021 Q4
* Implementation of the test plan is assumed to be started in July/August 2021
* Verification is expected to complete in 2022 Q1



## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project
* Finalize CV32E40 as originally intended in the [CV32E40 Features and Parameters](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/cores/cv32e40p/CV32E40P_and%20CV32E40_Features_Parameters.pdf) to propose a more powerful/optimized version of CV32E40.

***Part 2, PL fields:***
*The PL proposal explains the "what". Some of it can be updated directly from the PC proposal* 

# Title of Project - "CORE-V CoresProject XYZ"
# Project Launch Proposal
## Date of proposal - 2021-01-01
## Author(s) - Joe Smith, Mary Jones


## Summary of project

### Components of the Project

*Components are major project components or groups of features.*
- *A project may have, for example, 1-10 components.*
- *Components detail the "The what" at high level, not detailed level*
- *Components don't consider timeline.*
- *For example* 
  - *Component 1 "Compiler changes for standard instructions."* 
  - *Component 2 "Compiler changes for custom instructions"* 
  - *Component 3 "Updates to compiler tools".*

## Architecture and/or context diagrams 
*Architecture (internal blocks and interconnections), and context (depiction of the the project content within its operational context), are both encouraged where appropriate to depict functionality to both subject matter experts and to non-experts*



## Project license model

## Description of initial code contribution, if required

## Repository Requirements
