# Software TG Report July 2021

Presented to TWG meeting 26 July 2021.

## Actions from most recent meetings

Actions from [minutes of 12 July 2021](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/blob/master/meetings/2021/2021-07-12-minutes.md)

- **Richard Barry** to make a central list of all the different hardware FreeRTOS must support. Initially via Mattermost, but can be committed to the [core-v-sw](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw) repository in the [projects/freertos](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/tree/master/projects/freertos) directory.

- **Robert Balas** and **Shteryana Shopova** to consider running separate monthly calls for all those interested in FreeRTOS to coordinate actions.

- **All** to consider leading the SDK project.

## Reports on active projects

Links to reports on four Software TG projects and one joint Software/Hardware TG project.

* [IDE report](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/blob/master/projects/ide/2021/monthly-report-2021-07-12.md)

  - At Project Concept stage.
  - Next month:

	- Focus on PlatformIO integration.
	- Continue to ask for examples of applications to include
	- Speaking at upcoming RISC-V forum

* [GNU Tools report](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/blob/master/projects/gnu-tools/2021/monthly-report-2021-07-12.md):

  - At Project Concept stage.
  - This month
	- Can now run regression tests on the PULP simulator, GVSoC
	- Have run CORE-V specific tests

  - Next month:

	- Need to merge remaining instructions into binutils, waiting on a rebase
	- Work on fixing simulator failures
	- Work on GCC

* [FreeRTOS report](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/blob/master/projects/freertos/2021/monthly-report-12-july-21.md):

  - At Project Concept stage.
  - This month:

    - made a few changes to configuration and compile time options, so can also target CVA6.
	- formulated a plan to contribute upstream.

  - Next month:

	- Richard Barry to make central list of different hardware configurations to be supported.
    - consider mid-month meetings just for FreeRTOS

  - No risk register changes.

* [Clang/LLVM Tools report](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/blob/master/projects/clang-llvm/2021/monthly-report-2021-07-12.md):

  - At Project Concept stage.
  - CVA6

    - This month

	  - Scripted builds now supported alongside GCC. Supports versions with GNU ld and LLVM LLD.
	  - Fix to assembly level support of signalling NaN floating point in RISC-V assembly.
	  - Align CI/CD with CVA6 reorganization.

		  - GCC and both LLVM variants both agree on test results for CVA6

	- Next month

	  - finalize transition to new reorg
	  - fix any test issues
	  - do benchmarking.

  - CV32E40P

    - No change this month

  - No risk register changes.

* [Hardware Abstraction Layer report](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/blob/master/projects/hal/2021/monthly-report-2021-07-12.md)

  - At Project Concept phase
  - This month: comparison of options for HAL now on Mattermost for comment
  - Next month: Will start on minimal demo

* [Verilator modeling report to Software TG](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/hw/projects/verilator-model/2021/20210712-report.md) and [Verilator modeling report to Hardware TG](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/hw/projects/verilator-model/2021/202100721-report.md).  Note that this is Hardware TG led project, so this is only a report on the software component.

  - At Project Launch stage.
  - This month:

    - [project plan and risk register](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl_GIklam3redWNj_DRVRVVBD49LvLD8k1zeFsJXllc) updated;
	- software can now read and write DMI registers;
	- incorect behavior in CORE-V-MCU debug unit raised as issue [#150](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu/issues/150);
	- 6 milestones: milestone 1 complete, milestone 2 progress 42%; and
	- 4-5 week delay due to lack of resource and unanticipate complexity in modeling the debug module.

  - Next month:

    - complete JTAG driver (DMI driver, DMI, DTM and TAP tests); and
	- start work on initial Embdebug target library for CORE-V-MCU

  - [Risk register](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl_GIklam3redWNj_DRVRVVBD49LvLD8k1zeFsJXllc) changes:

    - likelihood increased for expert staff shortage;
	- new risk that estimates of effort are too low - mitigation is addressing highest risk items first and choosing simplest designs throughout.

## Upcoming projects

* **Requirements for CORE-V MCU developer board SDK**

  - Initial outline for Project Concept.
  - Key action is to identify strong, experienced project lead for SDK.

* **Linux integration**

  - No update this month.

* **Generalization of tools to other CORE-V architectures**

  - No update this month.
