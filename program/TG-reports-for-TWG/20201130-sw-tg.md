# Software TG Report November 2020

Presented to TWG meeting 30 November 2020.

## Overview

Four projects in progress

* **IDE:** Passed PPL gate
* **GNU Tools:** Passed PPL gate
* **Clang/LLVM Tools:** PPL under consideration 30 November 2020
* **FreeRTOS:** PPL under consideration 30 November 2020

## IDE project

Project lead: Alexander Fedorov

### Progress in current month

1. Contribute GNU toolchain to CORE-V IDE (50% complete)

   - discovered and fixed major architectural issue in Embedded CDT project

2. Prepare CORE-V IDE sources for Contribution Questionnaire (90%), hope to complete in the nearest days.

### Statistics

None yet available

### Risk register update

1. **Risk:** Difficulty identifying candidate projects to include as examples

   - **Mitigation:** HW TG "Hello World" program identified as candidate, support from team at CMC.  Future FreeRTOS project will yield starter project. More are needed

### Plans for next month

1. Complete GNU toolchain contribution for CORE-V IDE
2. start adopting application example for CORE-V IDE

## GNU Tools project

Project lead: Jessica Mills, Embecosm

### Progress in current month

* Added multiply accumulate support to GNU Binutils including full testing to OpenHW repos
* Added general ALU operations to GNU Binutils including full testing to OpenHW repos
* Added general ALU operations support to GNU GCC, not tested as awaiting simulator
* Added new `-march` option: `xcorevalu` (supports the general ALU operations subset) in both binutils and GCC
* Added post-increment and register-indexed load/store to GNU Binutils and begun adding tests
* Updated [CV32E40P User Manual](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/tree/master/cores/cv32e40p/user_manual) to include all CORE-V extensions.
* Embecosm effort now reducing, team partially redeployed (as planned) to other projects.

GNU gcc testing awaits suitable test target

### Risk register update

* Two new risks added:

  * No suitable target to test against - high risk as limits GCC testing
  * University of Bologna / ETH Zurich cannot get FSF assignment - low risk as mitigation plan in place

### Plans for next month

* Finish testing for post-increment and register-indexed load/store in GNU Binutils and add instruction set to GNU GCC
* Finalise testing for GNU GCC CORE-V hw loops, mac and alu
* Adding binutils-gdb and GCC changes to the OpenHW Group mirrors
* Upstreaming CORE-V support to binutils-gdb - awaiting mechanism of psABI vendor specific linker relocations
* Upstreaming CORE-V support to GCC - reliant on testing with simulator
* Repeat the process for direct branches (xcorevbi) as per the preliminary project plan

## Clang/LLVM Tools project

Project lead: André S, Thales

### Progress in current month

Key activities for CV32E40P

* Added Hardware Loop support in LLVM integrated assembler
* Fixed operand order in `cv.setupi` instruction
* Add HWLP support to `clang` (tests missing)
* Add memcopy optimization with HWLP (WIP)

Key activities for CVA6

### Statistics

CV32E40P Tasks:

| Category    | Last Month | This Month | Delta |
| -----------:| ----------:| ----------:| -----:|
| Unstarted   | 0          | 5          | +5    |

### Risk register update

CV32E40P risks:

* One new risk added:

  * No suitable target to test against - high risk as limits Clang/LLVM testing

### Plans for next month

General:

* Gain PPL approval from TWG

Tasks for CV32E40P:

* Implement MAC support
* Start implementing ALU support
* Possibly start implementing optimization passes

## FreeRTOS project

Acting project lead: Jeremy Bennett, Embecosm

### Progress in current month

* Shteryana Shopova is reading up documentation, looking up GitHub projects and has it running on a RaspberryPi for experimentation.
* Nexus A7 board shipped to Shteryan Shopova, due today
* 
### Statistics

None yet

### Risk register update

Two risks identified

* **Risk:** Robert Balas needs ETH Zürich approval to release his work publicly

  * **Mitigation:** Shteryana Shopova is starting a clean port as a training exercise.

* **Risk:** No permanent project manager identified yet

  * **Mitigation:** Reach out to wider OpenHW community for leader

* **Risk:** Lack of resource

  * **Mitigation:** Reach out to wider OpenHW community for support

* **Risk:** Board is delayed to Shteryana Shopova.

### Plans for next month

* Gain PPL approval from TWG
* Bring up core system on HW TG MCU on FPGA
