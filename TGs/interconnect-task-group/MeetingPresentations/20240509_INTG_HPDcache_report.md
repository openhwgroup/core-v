# CV-HPDCACHE

## Summary

Development and verification of a High-Performance L1 Dcache integrated with
the CVA6.

## Activities and progress since last report:

* Achievements:
  * Parametrization implemented: parameters of the HPDcache are now passed
    through a structure parameter during the instantiation. This allows
    having heterogeneous instantiations in the same system (multiple
    instances of the HPDcache with different parameters).

* Planned:
  * Add the HPDcache in the Thales' CVA6 UVM testbench (in progress)
  * Publish the HPDcache User Guide in the OpenHW ReadTheDocs server
  * Still working in the delivery of a preliminary testplan. Delayed until
    June'24
  * Working in the delivery of a preliminary testbench
  * Develop hybrid write-policy functionality
  * Develop scratchpad mode functionality

* Unplanned:
  * NA

## Issues and dificulties:

* Staff

## Gate status:

* Plan Approved
