## Project summary
The goal of the project is to bring all PULP instructions (disabled during **CV32E40Pv1** phase) in **CV32E40Pv2** to a **TRL5** maturity level and to provide an all aligned:
- Quality documentation
- Quality RTL
- High-coverage verification (formal and simulation)
- Reference Model
- SW GNU toolchain elements (GCC, BINUTILS, GDB...)

### Requirements
* Support of RV32IMC_Zicsr_Zifencei RISC-V extensions.
* Support of PULP instructions in X RISC-V extension. 
* Optional support of Single-Precision Floating Point F RISC-V extension.
* Optional support of Zfinx RISC-V extension.
* Optional support of PULP_CLUSTER instruction in X RISC-V extension.

### Timeline
* PF (Project Freeze): RTL release and project checklists completed by e/o June 2023.<br>
Workplan and Milestone are detailed below.

### Initial contribution
#### Core RTL
* Initial code is from CV32E40Pv1 cv32e40p_v1.0.0 release.
#### FPU RTL
* Initial FPU code is FPnew from ETH ZÃ¼rich and University of Bologna moved to OpenHW CV-FPU.
#### Verification
* Initial UVM simulation environment is OpenHW core-v-verif used for CV32E40Pv1.

### Project license model
* Solderpad License, Version 2.0

### Project distribution model
#### OpenHW web site & GitHub repositories
* Documentation: https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/cv32e40p-user-manual
* RTL: https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p
* Verification and Reports: https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif
* SW toolchain sources: https://github.com/openhwgroup/corev-gcc and https://github.com/openhwgroup/corev-binutils-gdb
#### Pre-compiled SW toolchain package can be downloaded from https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/#corev

## Verification methodology
It is based on both:
* Formal verification using Siemens EDA OneSpin tools and its RISC-V ISA verification app to accelerate the verification of more than 300 new instructions.
* Simulation verification of what can not be verified with Formal methodology like asynchronisms (interrupts & debug) or specific micro-architecture features (prefetch buffer,...).<br>
It is starting from [Step-and-Compare 1.0](https://core-v-verif-verification-strategy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cv32_env.html#step-and-compare) core-v-verif uvm environment used to verify CV32E40Pv1 which is upgraded first to support [Step-and-Compare 2.0](https://core-v-verif-verification-strategy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cv32_env.html#step-and-compare-2-0) (RFVI interface on Core side and RVVI on ISS side) to finally be compliant with ImperasDV framework methodology.

Gateways between OpenHW core-v-verif repositories and Dolphin Design internal environment (GitLab, ...) will be set up for internal jobs (debug, Continous Integration...).
