This update to both the 2022 Project Launch (PL) and 2023 Plan Approved (PA) Documentation for the CVE20 project is being proposed for TWG approval by OpenHW Staff. It updates both PL and PA fields. The reasons for the update are that fundamental things have changed with the project.
- The project team has changed. Verification work is now being driven directly by OpenHW Group staff rather than OpenHW Members, but Members are still encouraged to get involved.
- The scope of the E20 core project is slightly different. The originally included Core Complex is now deferred to a later version.
- Only a single configuration of the core (RV32IMC) is now included in the verification plan, and other configurations are deferred. 
- The verification environment adds Spike as the primary reference mode, and the creation of that model is part of this project. Support for the ImperasDV reference model is maintained but will not be integrated into the CI flow without direct support from the Membership.  

## Summary of project
  The CV32E20 proposed project develops a TRL5, area-efficient 2-stage microcontroller core based on Ibex 
as part of the CORE-V family of cores.


  The 2021 scope of the project included detailing which of the Ibex parameters are being removed, or verified, or neither verified or removed (left for future work). This has been largely completed as of 2024.

In 2021, completing design enhancements and integration of the interfaces into the core complex was planned. In 2024, most of the core complex aspects have been removed or simplified.

Completing verification, including creation of a Spike reference model, and documentation remains a key aspect of the project. 

## PL field: Components of the Project
### Component 1a "RTL design of the core". Note, this list constitutes the PA feature specification.  
- RTL design of the Core starting from Ibex with the following features:
  - I: Base Integer Instruction Set, with 32, 32-bit general-purpose registers
  - M: Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division
  - C: Standard Extension for Compressed 16-bit Instructions
  - Machine Mode 
  - Cleaning Ibex RTL of unused parameters 
  - Exposing privilege pins (privilege CSR bits are exposed as bus attribute signals)
  - Modification to make OBIv1.2-compliant bus interfaces.
  - Adding and extending the rvfi interface
  - CV32E40P-like Sleep unit
 
- No longer included in scope as of 2024:
  - E: Base Integer Instruction Set (embedded) with 16, 32-bit general-purpose registers
  - User Mode verification

 

### Component 1b "RTL design of the core complex". As of 2024 this Component is removed from the project

- Removed from project scope as of 2024:
  - Integrating interrupt controller - (Open Titan CLIC).
  - Integrating debug interface - similar to E40P
  - The "debug module interface" (DMI) and the "debug transport module" (DTM). (These are RISC-V terms used in the riscv-debug spec.) Note that while these are removed, the CV32E20 supports a debug interface and we will keep it. 
  - Integrating OBI2AHB bus bridges

### Component 2 "Documentation".
- Create core spec from existing Ibex documentation
- Create core complex specification (as of 2024 this is removed)
- Create verification plan and reports
  
### Component 3 "Verification of core complex". As of 2024 this is removed
Removed from project scope as of 2024:
- Based on core-v-verif environment 
- Verification of the Core ISA configurations: RV32IMC, RV32EMC
- Verification of the Core Complex: DUT0 with RV32IMC, DUT1 with RV32EMC

## Summary of market or input requirements:

This project is intended to support embedded applications where, for example, a state machine based implementation might otherwise be used. Additionally, this core is targeted for use in applications requiring a small 32-bit processing element.
The core configurably supports the RV32{E,I}MC instruction set but as said above, only the IMC instruction set is being verified.

The Tristan Project is motivating the completion of this work in 2025.

### Potential future enhancements for future project phases
- Zce static code size reduction opcode extension
- Supporting 2 pin compressed JTAG (CJTAG) debug interface
- Investigation of a "tiny FPU " implementation
  - Targeted at sensor computations at the edge 
  - Having FP would be useful for these and other computations
- Low granularity Physical Memory Protection (PMP) module

- At low level, specific tasks are enumerated with estimated time durations (e.g. 1 person for 2 weeks)* 
- If appropriate, tasks are assigned to individuals*
- For agile projects, tasks can be assigned to individuals during project execution. If so, initial task backlog without assignment to individual can be created.*
- Format of the WBS can be github project board, spreadsheet, or other*.
--->

The work breakdown structure at P.A. is shown in the CVE20 Project Board. 




## Schedule
<!--- A timeline view is created by considering the WBS breakdown, dependencies among tasks, resource availability, and schedule requirements. The format of the timeline view can be github project board with milestones, a spreadsheet, or gantt chart.

- The schedule should indicate the planned date of major milestones and the first release for the project
- Remaining uncertainties or issues to be resolved should be described
- How the schedule will be maintained following PA should be described
--->

- The Project Board will be regularly maintained by the Project Manager and will be used as a basis for discussion at weekly project meetings.



## Project Repo 



<!--- The project repo(s) should be setup and listed here*
The repos should have README.MD and LICENSE.MD created*
The LICENSE.MD file should specify the project license*
--->

The project repo is https://github.com/openhwgroup/cve2
The readme.md file is available https://github.com/openhwgroup/cve2/blob/main/README.md

The license.md file is available but should be updated to indicate Solderpad 2.1
https://github.com/openhwgroup/cve2/blob/main/LICENSE



## Regular Project Meeting 
<!--- The project should have a regular project meeting established and included on the OpenHW calendar. Send a recurring meeting request to meetings@openhwgroup.org
--->

Weekly project meeting every week at Thursday 8:00 Pacific / 11:00 Eastern Time/ 17:00 Central Europe 

## Regular Project Report
<!--- The project should have a regular project report agreed. The format of the report should follow the suggestion in the programs/template repo. Consult OpenHW staff as meeting report location*.
--->

The monthly project report will be prepared for the OpenHW Cores TG meeting. 
The report template at https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/blob/master/process/Project-Monthly-Report-Template.md will be used.
The reports will be stored at the cores-tg folder of the programs/TG repo via pull request


## Risk Register
*Risks towards completion of the project for the given target should be listed and risk mitigation plan should be stated*


| Risk								| Description						| Plan to Mitigate Risk					|      
| --------------------    			| --------------------    			| -------------------- 					|
| Mario's time may be constrained	| Mario's time may  be requested by CVA6 project					|	Encourage additional non-staff resource to participate						|
| Spike as reference model	    	| 	Scope of architecture decisions applicable to Spike not fully known				  				|				|
| Microarchitecture complexity causes issues	    | 	E.g. a difficult bug arises								|	Additional resource could be engaged via Tristan funding									|
| Lack of Design Lead for RTL	    | 							|											|


The major risk at the time of PA is that no resource is available for the RTL components that need to be done. OpenHW staff will encourage member companies to step in to this role and/or take other actions leading to a resource being made available.


## Checklists to pass the Project Finished/Project Release Gate
<!--- The checklists which will be used to gate the completion of the project should be listed. The checklists themselves don’t need to be presented at the PA gate. Steps to create them should be described.
