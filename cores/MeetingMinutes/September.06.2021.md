## CV32E20

Lee gave an update on the CV32E20 status (preparing for PL).

## CV32E40P

Pascal gave an update on the CV32E40P status (preparing for PL on September 27). CV32E40P will not use the eXtension interface.

## CV32E40X / CV32E40S

Arjan gave an update on the CV32E40X / CV32E40S status (slow progress by OpenHW on OneSpin tool installation is causing delays).

## CVA6 update

Jérôme Quevremont gave an update on the CVA6. CVA6 intends to use the eXtension interface, but at the same time intends to share FPU verification work with the CV32E40P project (which might conflict).

## Ara

Matheus gave an overview of the Ara (Vector coprocessor) integration with Ariane with focus on the load/store architecture, coherency and traps.
